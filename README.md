# Behemoth

Behemoth is a game made with Monogame in C# using Visual Studio, created after finishing a Udemy course on Monogame.
You play as a character running around a procedurally generated forest breaking trees and boulders.

Use Arrow keys to move around.
Hold shift to build up speed. Hitting an object while moving at high speeds lowers the object's durability, possibly destroying it.
Hold and release space bar to build up and release an attack, destroying trees and sending boulders and enemies flying away, damaging anything they hit.

Sprinting drains your stamina. Your strength regenerates quickly after attacking, draining your stamina as well.

New trees appear over time based on how many trees are in the area, allowing the forest to regenerate somewhat realistically.

The game is unfinished, with no plans of continuing its development.
The unimpressive art was drawn by me, and mostly served as placeholders for future assets.
